# Introduction

This repository contains my Vim configurations.

# Mapped Keys
 - `<leader>` has been mapped to the key `;`

# Installed Plugins

## Code Format
 - `google/vim-codefmt`
 - refer to the Github page for configuration
 - for C++, install clang-format, e.g., `brew install clang-format`
 - for Python, install yapf, e.g., `pip install yapf`
 - for Bazel, install `buildifier`, refer to <https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/buildifier/README.md>
 - files are auto formated on save; reformated files overwrite current files!

## Color Scheme
 - altercation/vim-colors-solarized
 - tomasr/molokai

## Comment
 - [scrooloose/nerdcommenter][2]
 - `<leader>`cc, to comment the current line or selected lines
 - `<leader>`c`<space>` to toggle the comment of the current line within selected lines
 - `<leader>`cs, s is short for sexy, i.e., beautiful comment.
 - `<leader>`cm, m is short for minimal comment, i.e, use `/* */` instead of `//`

## Directory Window
 - [scrooloose/nerdtree][3]
 - [jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs][4]
 - `<C-n>`, i.e., press ctrl + n to toggle the directory window
 - Inside the directory window
   - the upper case `i` to toggle hidden files
   - `t` to open the file in a new tab
   - `s` to vertically split the window and open the file in the split window
   - `<Enter>` to open the file in the current tab

## Fix Trailing and Leading Spaces
 - bronson/vim-trailing-whitespace
 - the trailing/leading spaces are shown in red
 - `:FixWhiteSpace` to delete trailing/leading spaces of the whole file or the selected region

## Fuzzy File Finder
 - `kien/ctrlp.vim`
 - settings: `let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'`
 - press `<c-p>`, i.e., ctrl + p to find the file (case-insensitive) in the current directory and subdirectories

## Indent Guides
 - `nathanaelkane/vim-indent-guides`
 - `<leader>ig` to toggle indent guides

## Indent Line
 - `Yggdroot/indentLine`
 - Show indents with lines

## Mark Visualization
 - `kshenoy/vim-signature`
 - `ma` to create a mark named `a`
 - remember how to jump to mark `a`: backtick -- column, `'` -- beginning of the line
 - `dma` to delete mark `a`
 - `m-` to delete the mark in the current line
 - `m<space> to delete all marks
 - `m,` to allocate the next available mark for the current line

## Python Auto Completion
 - `davidhalter/jedi-vim`
 - `ctrl + g` to show/hide completion suggestions.

## Repeat
 - tpope/vim-repeat
 - Install this plugin so that `.` works for commands defined by other plugins

## Resize or Move Split Windows
 - `simeji/winresizer`
 - First press `ctrl + E`
    * it enters *resize* mode, press `j`, `h`,`k`, or `l` to resize windows.
    * to change it to *move* mode, press `m` or `e`, then press `j`, `h, `k`, or `l`
    * to change it to *focus* mode, press `f`, then press `j`, `h, `k`, or `l`

## Status Line
 - vim-airline/vim-airline
 - vim-airline/vim-airline-themes

## Tagbar
 - install ctags first, e.g., `brew install ctags`
 - `<leader>ilt` to toggle the tagbar window
 - it is shown in the right side, since the left side is for the directory window

## YouCompleteMe
 - **CAUTION**: Do NOT use it as it eats up too much resources. Use [./init-nvim.sh](./init-nvim.sh) instead
 - `cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` or `set( CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON )`,
 which generate a file `compile_commands.json` in the build directory.
 - symlink it to the project root directory.
 - ;gl to go to declaration
 - ;gf to go to definition
 - ;gi to go to include
 - ;gg to go to declaration or definition
 - ctrl + o to go backward
 - ctrl + i to go forward
 - If anaconda is used, compile YouCompleteMe with `/usr/bin/python install.py`

## deoplete
  - `pip3 install pynvim`
  - `apt-get install python3-neovim`. NOTE: it requires `sudo` permission.
  - It consumes less resource than YouCompleteMe.
